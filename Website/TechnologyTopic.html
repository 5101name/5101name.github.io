				<p class="marginadded">- The first innovation is the decoding of the human genome, which has given scientists the chance to further understand how human genetics works and provides an understanding of DNA sequencing.</p>
				<p class="marginadded">- The second innovation involves the use of the DNA editing technology CRISPR. CRISPR is an acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Cas9, which is designed to work with a protein called Cas9. 
					<br>Cas9 is an “enzyme that acts like a pair of molecular scissors, capable of cutting strands of DNA” (Jinek et al., 2012). According to the (Broad Institute, 2018), the point of CRISPR is to essentially “allow scientists to quickly create cell and animal models, which researchers can use to accelerate research into diseases such as cancer.” 
					<br>The wellbeing and quality of life for humans are remarkably quickly improving thanks to biotechnology advancements. The community is now having ethical debates, though, as a result of new therapies and treatments. Gene therapy is a good illustration of this. The process of "inducing a directed and specific modification in the DNA sequence of humans or other living beings" is known as gene therapy (de Lecuona et al., 2017). At specific places in the genome, nucleotides are added, deleted, or substituted to achieve this (de Lecuona et al., 2017). Clinical trials for gene therapies are now being conducted, rather than just basic research (Lynch, 2019). Nearly 3000 clinical trials were registered as of May 2019, with 300 of those moving on to Phase III (Lynch, 2019). This research will examine the current moral, legal, social, and safety concerns surrounding the ground-breaking gene editing technology that is currently being developed. The first technological innovation generating interest and excitement in the scientific community right now is somatic gene editing. "The transfer of genes into the patient's somatic cells," according to the definition of somatic gene therapy, is most of the time, normal alleles are transferred, which could "correct" the recipient's mutant or disease-causing alleles (The Open University, 2019). </p>
